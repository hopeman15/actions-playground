# GitHub Actions Playground

This is a playground project to test action workflows.

## Auto Release

This will automatically create a release including release notes if the label
is set to `release ðŸŽ‰ `. In order to bump the version set either `major ðŸ¥‡`, 
`minor ðŸ¥ˆ` or `patch ðŸ¥‰` to automatically bump the version accordingly.

#### Example
If the current version is `0.9.0` then:
* `major ðŸ¥‡` -> `1.0.0`
* `minor ðŸ¥ˆ` -> `0.10.0`
* `patch ðŸ¥‰` -> `0.9.1`
